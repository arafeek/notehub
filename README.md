#### [NoteHub](http://www.notehub.xyz)  
is an idea for a service that aims help to simplify a few processes:
* Easy, real-time generation of well formatted documents supporting multiple markup syntaxes
* Online publishing of created content
* Collaboration on written works between multiple users.

Currently, most of these services already exist in some shape or form (Google Docs, GitHub,
various online note editors), but my goal for this project was just to create a tool with 
a desired combination of these features, with a low technical barrier to entry.
